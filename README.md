# Automatic-System-Upkeep
A transferrable script that: automatically scans a network for active hosts, lists their port and service information, 
formats information in a user-friendly way, and automatically uploads the results. 
It also compares the results of this current scan to the previous scan of the same system, and sends the results as an email.
